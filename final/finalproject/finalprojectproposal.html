    <main>
        <h1>1. The title and topic of your site.</h1>
        <p>The title of the website that I am planning to create is something about travel agency that is related to the Philippines. The website would show a lot of things about the Philippines especially places to visit.</p>

        <h1>2. A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h1>
        <p>I choose this topic because although Philippines is a well-known country now, I believe it has a lot to offer and making a website that shares what the philippines is and the following places that could be visited by a person could help them in their travel. In addition, this is why I am planning to create a form that's asks questions related to account creation and asks for some valid documents.</p>

        <h1>3. List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</h1>
        <p>First page will be called the home page where some information about the philippines is displayed. </p>
        <p>Second page will be informations about places to visits in the philippines (Highlights; Top 10 places in the philippines) I am planning to use containers on this one that has display:flex as an attribute?</p>
        <p>Third would be list of other places in the philippines that uses a table. I am planning to at least write down 30 to 40 places from the northernmost part to the southernmost part of the Philippines</p>
        <p>fourth, I am planning to write some blogs about a certain place in the Philippines.</p>
        <p>fifth would be a create page where if they click it they can create an account and submit a form to create an account. (if it's possible for the following page to be the sixth page then that's what I am planning to work on)</p>
        <p>sixth page could be an about us page.</p>


        <h1>4. What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</h1>
        <p>name, email address, contact number, age, password, confirm password, upload a document for verification, then a submit button.</p>

        <h1>5. How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h1>
        <p>I am planning to use google for images.</p>
        <p>I am also planning to look out for pages in the social media like facebook for blogs about places in the philippines.</p>

        <h1>6. Include a statement acknowledging that you have read the warnings below.</h1>
        <p>i have read the warnings.</p>
