        Note: create a relative tag in your navigation bar to your second page (described below). You should also include a link that links to the current page (this page). You can remove the link and just show text if you want to highlight which page you are on.
    </header>

    <body>
        <h3>(Explain my interest )Why I like Star Trek: Discovery</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>What is a relative link and absolute link?</h3>
        <p>A relative link means a way to tell the browser where it can find another file such as webpages, images, and etc that is related to the current file. In addition, instead of providing the whole web address you will only need to provide the path of the files current location. On the other hand, absolute link means you have to provide a complete URL that includes the protocol, the domain name, and the specific path to a file or a website. In short, using absolute links makes sure that when a user click a link, it make sures that they reach the correct destination. </p>

        
        <p>Explanation must be inputed here. Include a relative link to your first assignment. Also, explain here as well what is absolute link and then add a link to an external website that is about your interest.</p>

<p>Note: 

    This page should highlight a famous person that is involved in your selected interest. This could be an athlete, actor/actress, etc. Besides the content you should correctly use the following:

This page should use the same structural tags (HEADER,NAV,MAIN,FOOTER) as the interests page. The content in the NAV and FOOTER should be the same as the previous page, except which link is just text in the navigation bar (if you did that). The HEADER CONTENT should appear the same as the previous page, but a title/subtitle should be changed to indicate this page is about the hero. The two navigation links should remain in the same order.
In the main tag should include the following:
A paragraph tag, with text about the "hero". DO NOT COPY TEXT FROM ANOTHER SITE.
A description list  (DL with DD DT tags)with information about the hero. (Could be a list of movies and what roles they played, or seasons with stats for an athlete, etc.) You must include at least 3 list items.
