        <h3>Interest and Why I like Star Trek: Discovery</h3>

        <p>Aloha! My name is Jim and I'd be happy to share to you what I am interest in and how I was able to develop this interest in me. As a child, I've been exposed to numerous gadgets and devices like landphones, printers, and computers. I can still vividly remember  the time when I first played a web-based game called "Pokemon Crater" and it made me excited when I play it with my siblings. In addition to this, I can also remember the days how I toyed and destroy the floppy disk in our homes because I was curious. I was scolded by my dad but I get to know what was the thing that was inside. This early, exposure is why I had a great interest in learning computers, how to code, and other gadgets that common in our generation. In addition to these, I believe my early exposure to technology is why I start to appreciate sci-fi movies; a genre that explores infinite possibilities related to technology, a possibility of what human can achieve, and how our actions can affect in a massive or global scale. With these descriptions mentioned, is why I started watching Star-Trek series. </p>

        <p>The first three movies of Star-Trek in the 21st century is the reason why I started watching their newest series like Star-Trek: Picard, Star-Trek: Next Generations, and especially Star-Trek: Discovery. But, out of these three the best series for me would be the star-trek-discovery because of few different reasons:</p>
        <p>1. I love the plot of the series; It shows us how turning to our greatest fear can bring destruction around us and how a simple glimmer of hope can help us attain a better outcome in our protracted situations. In addition to this, It teaches us to face our circumstances and difficult situations despite the presence of fear. To face our greatest unknowns, and how learning cultures and how various species interact with their own can bring intercultural peace and unity between diverse races.</p>
        <p>2. Technology; This movies just inspires me the possiblity technology and it's advancement. </p>
        <p>3. Graphics; I love how they portay what space-time travel looks like and It also shows me the difference of how people's life is kinda different to our life now especially with regards to what we see in the movies/series. If before, its all black and white, now there's a lot of things that we can do with the use of CGI.</p>

        <h3>What is a relative link and absolute link?</h3>

        <p>A relative link means a way to tell the browser where it can find another file such as webpages, images, and etc that is related to the current file. In addition, instead of providing the whole web address you will only need to provide the path of the files current location or the name of the page/file itself. On the other hand, absolute link means you have to provide a complete URL that includes the protocol, the domain name, and the specific path to a file or a website. In short, using absolute links makes sure that when a user click a link, it make sures that they reach the correct destination. </p>
