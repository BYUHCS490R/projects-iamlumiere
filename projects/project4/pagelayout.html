            <p>This is the story of an individual named Micheal Burnham who went through a hardship due to her poor-decision making which was inflicted by their protracted situation; an ongoing war with a savage and aggressive race called the Klingons. She was court-matialed for going against her captain's orders and was stripped of rank. Luckily, the captain of U.S.S Discovery saw her potential and was recruited as a xeno-anthropologist or a science officer.</p>
        
            <p>The adventures of their starship called U.S.S Discovery includes how they won the Klingon war due to the technology they possessed called the spore drive, which makes it possible to travel instantaneously accross the galaxy and even through a mirror dimension. It also includes the story of how they investigate multiple signals sent by an individual from the future called "the red angel" and how they fought a rouge AI. This story ended with the discovery and it's crew traveling 900 years into the future. In addition, it also showed the reconstruction of Starfleet in the future due to a desctructive event called "the burn" which wiped out majority of the starships; friends of foe. Also. It includes story where the U.S.S discovery had to travel across the edge of the galaxy to communicate with an unknown entity that send a collector device that caused major desctruction in the protagonist's universe. Lastly, the story ended when Micheal Burnham had received a mission about the progenitor's technology which they found orbiting near the blackhole and was tested by the progenitors itself whether she's worthy to wield the technology that creates life. In the end, she understand that life in the universe itself now is sufficient and adding more race isn't what they need, but rather the connection and being united with one another is what the world they lived in need.
