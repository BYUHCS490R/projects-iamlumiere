    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p class="justified-paragraph">Aloha Everyone! My name's Markham but people call me Jim. I live in the southern province of the Luzon island called Bicol and I live in <em>Naga City, Camarines Sur in the Philippines</em>. Our city has a tagline of <q>Ang Maogmang Lugar</q> which translates to <q>The Happy Place</q> due to it's welcoming and positive atmosphere. In addition to this, our city is also known for our campaign for tourism <q>Naga Yon!</q> which was derived from the bicolano word <q>minagayon</q> meaning <q>to improve</q>, <q>to become better</q>, or <q>to progress</q>. 
    </p>

    <p class="justified-paragraph">As an individual, one of the best things that I've learned after my mission is learning to do things alone. To travel to unknown places just by myself, to be comfortable doing thing by myself, and to get used to just by being with myself. Probably because of how my mission stretched me to always go out of my comfort zone and to always act while in the growth zone despite the presence of fear. Thus, I always do things that makes me independent. Like going to a hike just by myself, swim to the beach, or watch a movie in a theater. </p>


    <h3>Hobbies and Interest:</h3>
    <p class="justified-paragraph">I am a dog person, back home we have a family dog named Pops; a white aspin who loves to play and spend time with us. When it comes to music, I like pop-rock, old songs like from the 70s to 90s, Kpop, and of course OPM or Original Pilipino Music. When it comes to entertainment, I find Sci-fi movies interesting. I love films that tackles about possible futures, politics and real life events like Schiendler's list, and deep space travel like Star Trek, Star Wars, and the Alien series.</p>

    <p class="justified-paragraph">When it comes to sports or physical activities I love playing volleyball and table tennis. But, just this recently because of school and work I find it difficult to play the sports that I like. However, This difficulty led me to learn new things like going to the gym where I find using the threadmill and lifting weights stress reliving and comforting. In addition to these, It also led me to learn how to play piano. Although I am having difficulty reading the sharps and bases but I am glad of the progress that I made in the last couple of weeks where I'm comfortable and good of reading and playing musical sheet without such signs.
