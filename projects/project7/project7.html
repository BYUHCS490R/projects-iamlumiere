                    There are still numerous games that are being released every year. While this is the case, you might be surprised to know that the majority of the games played in 2025 are actually not the new games but rather the older games. In this table we are recapping the top 10 games played in 2025 which have been gathered from different sources like activeplayer.io, statistica, and MMO-population. 
                </p>

                   It is worth noting that these figures aren't official and are just estimates based on the data provided and may change every month. It is also important to take note that the data gathered has a huge marigin for error. In addition, some games would appear more popular because they are played on other platform such as xbox, PS5, or Mobile Phone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the table, each game contains their ranking based on the number of players, developer of the  game, number of players in the last 30 days, how much player was gain/loss, and the percentage of gain/loss. This data gathered from various sources could be used as a recommendation for new gamers  who are trying to explore games that are much older than them.  
                </p>

                <p>There are a lot of factors why games are played, it could be due to their graphics, the gameplay, or the community. As these factors improved, it is possible to assume that we can increase the number of players in these games.</p>
