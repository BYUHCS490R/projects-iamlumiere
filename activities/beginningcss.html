        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <h3>1. Explain the difference between inline, embbeded, and external CSS</h3>
        <p style="color: blue;font-size: larger;">
            - Inline is about adding attribute to your tags. example would be this example. Also, this is the next priority next to html attributes
        </p>
            - Embedded css is the next priority to inline. Embedded css is about adding a style tag. It can only go inside your head tag. you cannot put it in your body tag.
        <p>
            - External CSS, the lowest priority. The last cascading. It can be overwritten by inline and embedded css. You do it by creating a css file and then on the head, you type link and use the link with css command, then after you can link your css file by either using relative or absolute path by using / sing.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h3>
        <p>
            - Why we dont use inline and embedded? because theres a programmer and graphic designer, as programmer you are doing the html. The graphic designer's task is to create a css file. If you add inline, it's going to override their work. Another reason, If it's not uniform, it could make your webpage not good. There's only one css file that's shared in all the webpage.
        </p>

        <h3>3. What is selector for?</h3>
        <p>
            - The selector is used to decide which part of your html gets your css applied to them. There are different selectors that will be discussed next week. 
        </p>
        <p>
            - If you want to make your style added to a specific area, just put the main tag first then a specific tag. example[header h1]
        </p>

        <p>Note: Cascading, is about priority that you have. The most priority that you have is HTML attributes like strong. Then inline css.  </p>
