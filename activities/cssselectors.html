        <h3>What is the difference between an ID and a Class? </h3>
        <p>- ID is an attribute which are placed in the opening tag to put a name to a specific tag. When we use an ID, you cannot name other tags with the same name. If you have a name called truth, you cannot name other tags with truth. While class, you can do more than one. You can add more tags from CSS to it. </p>
        <h3>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag? </h3>
        <p>- Span tag is used to manipulate a specific section within the html. It is like a block tags. Div tag is used to group things together, the difference is div tag will cause line breaks.</p>
        <h3>What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, and FOOTER? </h3>
        <p>- The division is use to group while the header is used to </p>
        <H3>What are the different ways to select a color? </H3>
        <p>- In the color, just click the small box and pick which color you like. Also, when given a set of numbers, its called the RGB. The first color is red, next is green, then the last is blue. If you see another that means it's an alpha channel which makes the color see-through.You can also use the hashtag then there's a value starting from 1 to 9 then A to F. The higher which is F the stronger the color.</p>

        <p>note: 
            -It's not recommended to add your own font, it might be harder to be read so there might be a problem that might surface.
