        <h1>Structural Tags</h1>

        <p>The tags head, body, meta, html, there are important tags than can be called fundamental structural tags.</p>
        <p>There are different structural tags:</p>

        <p>1. Header tag: The upper part of the website. Sometimes, this is the area where you can see the logo, name, and search engine.</p>
        <p>One example would be the BYUH name, BYUH logo, search engine of amazon.</p>
        <p>Note: If you're going to create a website, make sure that header is in all your webpages.</p>

        <p>2. Navigation Tag: Navigation is either inside the header, top of the header, or below the header. Sometimes, the header would be sideways or even the navigation tags. Navigation helps you see the different section of the websites. You can also insert some links in your navigation tags. Why do we use navigation tags? When you google something, like the byuh page, you can already see a section when you can just directly go to a specific webpage.</p>

        <p>3. Main Tag: If you have an assignment and you are tasked to create 2 pages, you can copy and paste the code here and just change it inside. It's like the body of the webpage.</p>

        <p>4. Footer Tag: The very bottom of the webpage is the footer; What you put in the footer are the kind of things that people doesn't commonly search on.</p>
        <p>Note: When you're creating you're html, you are just describing things to google. You can't copy but you can cite your sources. If you post something online, just make ysure you're not violating the copyrights law.</p>
        
        <p>HTML Validator: Just go to google and type html validator, you have to do it to check for errors. </p>

        <h3>Important Note: If you're going to turn your assignments, make sure you are now using the header, main, and the footer.</h3>
