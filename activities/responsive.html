            <h3> Questions:</h3>
            <p>1. Why is the viewport meta tag important? </p>
            <p> It's undoing things that safari did for webpages. It makes created webpages to tell browser how it must be scaled depending on the devices. </p>

            <p>2. How can you adjust the CSS for printing?</p>
            <p> You can adjust it by adding another link on the head of your webpage. Look on the head of this HTML file. In addition, you also have to remove some contents such as the navigation if it isn't needed and etc.</p>

            <p>3. When would you want to adjust the CSS for printing?</p>
            <p>Depending on the need of the person, if they want it to look good when it printed then that's the time to add the link of css that's designed for printing. Probably for news or academic articles. But mostly, people doesn't care about it.</p>

            <p>notes: Applications are just webpages in an application like this visual studio code, It's just an javascript combined with html? article tag is used to help google understand that a section is an article. Also, article is also just a div tag.</p>
