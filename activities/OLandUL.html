    <h3>4. What are phrase tags?</h3>
    <p>Phrase tags are similar to formatting in excel, it gives emphasis and life on a specific text enclosed to it.</p>
    
    <h3>5. What is the difference between OL and UL Tags?</h3>
    <p> &lt; ul &gt; is an unordered list tag. it is used to create a list of items inside where the order does not matter and is physically displayed with bullet points. TL;DR - It's an unordered list. Meaning it's ok if its not organize. While the &lt; ol &gt; the opposite of ul tag which is used to create a define list where the order of items is important and explicitly marked with numbers or letters. You can add an element and change a value to it. example would be the type="I". The value of the type changes what are on lettering, number, or the numeral on the left side of the text.</p>
    
    <p>Example: Unordered List</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Patty</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Bun</li>
        <li>Mayo</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Example: Ordered List</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Bun</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Mayo</li>
        <li>Patty</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Bun</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>6. What is a DL?</h3>
    <p>DL is a decription list or also called a definition list. similar to ol and ul, it is used to list terms with thier definitions and descriptions. With this, you are creating a structure similar to a glossary.</p>

    <p>Example: Description List</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Bun</dt>
        <dd>A bun is a type of bread that is round and small enough that it can generally be eaten hand-held. </dd>
    </dl>


    <p>Note:</p>
    <p> &lt; li &gt; is a list tag, you can't put other tags inside it. It has a parent child relationship with UL and OL</p>
    <p>You have to be wary with two browsers: chrome and firefox. Due to it's rendering engine. These two have different rendering engine.</p>
