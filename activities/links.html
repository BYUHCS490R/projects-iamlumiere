        <h2>Questions and Mini-Activities: </h2>
        <h3>1. Link to an outside website with an absolute link.</h3>
        <p> This is link directs you to the website of the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. </a> </p>

        <h3>2. What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</h3>
        <p> The root is the primary link of your website without any path. One example would be "http://127.0.0.1:3000/". Everything starts in your root which is the starting path. Folder and file names are part of the path.
        </p>

        <h3>3. What is a default document?</h3>
        <p>A default document is the primary page that you want your user to see. Without the default page, your user will see everything, the folder of your files for projects, activities, and other folders in your server. There's only one default document per folder. </p>

        <h3>4. Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links? </h3>
        <p> You use relative path if you're in the same domain name. While you use absolute link if you're trying to include an external link or other websites in your webpages. We call it absolute link because it has everything, the domain name, the path, and etc.</p>

        <h3>5. Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).</h3>
        <p> This link directs you to the <a href="StructuralTags.html">Structural Tags Page.</a> </p>

        <h3>6. List the 3 rules with relative links.</h3>
        <p> </p>

        <h3>7. Link to your last project.</h3>
        <p> This link directs you to the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/projects/InterestsPage.html?serverWindowId=45215f95-8b16-4a46-9758-bd64e4350dc2">Profile Page Project</a> </p>

        <h3>8. Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h3>
        <p> No, links can be everywhere in your webpage. Links on NAV tag means what are the following things inside your webpages; to make it easier to navigate your page.</p>

        <p>Note: Every file has default document</p>
