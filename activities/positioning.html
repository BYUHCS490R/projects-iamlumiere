        <h1>Questions: </h1>
        <h2>1. What is normal flow in HTML?</h2>
        <p> - </p>

        <h2>Example: </h2>
        <figure class="meme1">
        <img src="sample picture.jpg" alt="Cat meme picture">
        <figcaption>Cat Suspicious Meme</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>2. What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h2>
        <p> - It can move the image either to the right or left side while also moving the text on the side. float properties let the paragraph share a space with someone. There's a way to stop if you don't want to share a part of the code in the float by adding a div tag and add a class. You can also add the class for clear in the paragraph. </p>
        <div class="clear"></div>

        <h2>3. What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h2>
        <p> - relative makes it possible to move the picture around but there's going to be a spaces left. Absolute completely ignores everything and put the image at the top of the of the text or h1 or everything.If you're not happy with the order, you can add z-index. Fixed makes something stays in your screen even if you scoll down. Mostly used in headers </p>

        <figure class="meme2">
        <img src="sample picture.jpg" alt="Cat meme picture">
        <figcaption>Cat Suspicious Meme</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>4. How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h2>
        <p> - </p>

        <h2>5. Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h2>
        <p> - Go to home page, click lecture notes, and then just scroll down and look.</p>

        <p>Note: We cannot add height, width, and other stuff on inline code. The image that we have is an inline block tag but it's advance so we're not going to do it. Figure tag wants the whole width. Figure tags has a built-in margin, we can remove it by adjusting the width. In the anchor tag, if you put # in the link, this makes it valid when you put it in the validator. Pseudo class can be hover. </p>
        <p>Fragment identifier, It is through the use of the ID property or tag? then in css use # (hashtag) </p>
