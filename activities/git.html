        1. How do you get help?
    </h4>

    <p>
        We get help by reaching out to our professors or our tutors. In addition, we can also ask the internet or chatgpt 
        for answers to our questions like what the definition is and other stuff except for code itself.

        2. What time are engagement assignments due? Can you turn them in late?
        what if you miss one?
    </h4>

    <p>
        Engagement assignments are also called activities. Engagement assignments are 
        due every 11:59 PM or every midnight of the day of our class. Remember to not spend a
        lot of time doing your assignments. It's okay to miss some assignments because you are sick
        but let brother slade know.
