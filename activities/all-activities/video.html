            What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube?

            Note: Audio and videos are inline tag instead of block tags. Do not add big large files or video, github won't let you push and sync the file. It might result in a bug in your respository. If you're trying to host a video from free websites, they're not going to let you and they're going to charge you. The best would be to upload it to youtube then once uploaded click the share on the buttom of the video then click embbed and then copy then paste it. iframe is used to add an external webpage and embedding it to another person's webpage. The positive of youtube is free, the negative is you'll get adds for other people. Another would be the recommendations at the end. Sometimes, youtube is block so it's a challenge for it to watched. There's a code in css called the transform that makes you rotate your videos. There's also called animation, so instead of changing something immediately, you can add it to add a transition time.
