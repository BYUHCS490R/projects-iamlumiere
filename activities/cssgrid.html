            <h2>Questions: </h2>

            <h2>1. Please describe the parent-child relationship in HTML and why it becomes essential when using flex and grid.</h2>
            <div class="parent">
                <p class="child"> Parent has a box that contains it. Each tag wants to have a 100% width of it. Best practice is always to identify the parent and if there isn't then create one to control the children in inside or the tags. Block tags can be a parent or a child. </p>
                <p class="child">
                    I am a child 2, example only.
                </p>

                <p class="child">
                    I am a child 3, example only.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>2. What are the two main differences between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h2>
            <p>Grid: The parent tag is now ganna layout his kid inside not the normal flow and its not ganna let the other parents outside to control what's inside. Grid is only 2 dimentsional. It's like the parent dictates what the child space would be.</p>
            <p>Flex: It kinda ask the child what the space it need.</p>

            <p>Note: </p>
