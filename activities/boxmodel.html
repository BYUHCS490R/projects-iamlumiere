It's kinda putting all like images together put them in the screen. blocks that aren't block tags are called inline tags which are an in anchor link tag, the span tag, and the image tag. in addition, it could be the strong, mark and ____. while the rest, are block tags. Normal Flow - 100% width. What can we do with the box? we can control the height and width. You can control the image due to inline-block tag but that all that you can do.</p>

Margin is pushing the box inside from the screen, the padding is pushing to inside from the box.</p>
